       - Lexical Resource
       - Grammatical Range and Accuracy
       - Pronunciation
    - Risk tolerances: max filler words/minute, max pause ratio, minimum relevance score

    - Composite score:
       - `Composite = sum(weight_i x normalized_dimension_i)`
    - Decision bands:
       - `Strong Fit`: composite >= 80 and no critical threshold breach
       - `Potential Fit`: composite 65-79 or one non-critical breach
       - `Needs Review`: composite 50-64 or two non-critical breaches
       - `Not Ready`: composite < 50 or any critical threshold breach
