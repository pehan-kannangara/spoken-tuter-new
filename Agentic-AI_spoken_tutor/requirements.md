4. Visualize metrics: speed, filler words, lexical diversity.

### 4.6. Personalized Learning Pathway

1. Analyze weakest skill dimensions, level, timeline, and goals.
2. Generate weekly roadmap using activity bank tagged by level, band, topic, and difficulty.
3. Avoid repetition using activity history.

### 4.7. Progress Tracking & Gamification

1. Visual progress bar for level/band progression.
2. Streak system for consecutive practice days.
3. Weekly consistency tracker.
4. Milestone badges and achievement notifications.
5. Optional social sharing of achievements.

### 4.8. Teacher Dashboard & Analytics

1. Class-level analytics: average level, skill distribution heatmap, improvement trends, at-risk students.
2. Individual student reports: timeline graphs, skill breakdown, activity completion.
3. Exportable reports for academic monitoring.

### 4.9. Recruiter Screening Integration

1. Screening profiles based on recruiter criteria.
2. API calls to/from TA systems for candidate data.
3. Agentic question selection and scoring for screens.
4. Provide screening status and scores to recruiter systems.

### 4.10. Data Management

1. Relational database for users, classes, transcripts, scores, activity history, improvement records, streaks, badges, risk flags.
2. Speech processing module for transcription and acoustic analysis.
3. Export facilities for research data.

### 4.11. Continuous Improvement & Monitoring

1. Automated detection of stagnation or decline using threshold rules.
2. Flag at-risk students for teacher intervention.
3. Track operational cost metrics for AI usage.

## 5. Non-functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: Support thousands of concurrent users, horizontal scaling of services.
- **Security**: GDPR/FERPA compliance, encrypted storage of audio and personal data.
- **Performance**: Low latency for assessments and feedback generation.
- **Modularity**: AI services modular and invoked asynchronously.
- **Reliability**: High availability of core services, backups for data.
- **Maintainability**: Clean code, documented APIs, configuration-driven logic.
